   Portraits visualize something in three dimensions as a two-dimensional image.
I tried to make a portrait of my hand in 11 dimensions.
First I started this project with the 'Superstring Theory'. Basically, the 'Superstring Theory' describes the world in 10 or 11 dimensions. On the Web, we can easily find an 11-dimensional visual model made to explain the theory. I became interested in this shape. 
62 images were extracted from one visual model and drew my left hand in thoes images. And I tried to reconnect these drawing
