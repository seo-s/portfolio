      Hello I am Jisoo Seo and I am a person who is fan of art. There is a typical Asian story
Yes I wanted to do art stuffs when I was young~
But my parents wanted me to go medical school.
I was very math-science person when I was a teenager.
BTW I am 27 years old, was born in 1992 so sad.
Anyway I applied for Fashion business major behind my parents back. And it was my first bold choice in my life. I thought fashion is pretty close to art since I had never done art practice before. Time flied. I graduated from University with fashion major without any other bold choice. Just played everyday. So, I got a job satisfying with my first bold decision. I worked for an year and half in fashion industry as an trend R&D. Trend Research and Development part. I literally worked from 7am to 11pm and it made me think about my life again. Am I going well? Due to the nature of the job, I was forced to see many art exhibitions and articles at that time along with fashion collections. And it made me remind me of what I liked and like most. 
I prayed a lot for brave. Finally I made a decision. I quit my job. It was second my bold decision. I am sure that It’s hard to quit a job whenever I am paid and see the money in my account. And I got a new job at museum for the first step to the art world. I had prepared portfolio while working in the museum for an year.
I worked until July this year. And I am here, California Institute of the Arts. Nice to meet you. It was my weird career. Who am I as an artist?
If I know what I do as an artist, I would not be in school. Basically I am here for finding my area. So I am trying to do variously experiencing everything. But I have things that I like and prefer. I am going to tell them to you. I think I always have this process.
Observing Thinking a lot(studying) and making.
And as you can see, I really like transparency things.
I use them a lot. And also you can tell. I like to mix technology with very non digital things. Like this presentation. And I have some favorite artists
One is Krzysztof Wodiczko. Maurizio cattelan and Haegue yang. Please check them, they are really great. And you can be knowing me more. Actually I am not going to say who am I as an artist with this presentation. Sorry.
If you want to know me as an artist, Then you should come to my exhibition. I cannot tell that with words.
